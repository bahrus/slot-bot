# slot-bot

slot-bot provides a way to declaratively "ferry" a replica of the light children into the Shadow DOM realm. Once inside the shadowDOM, among other things, encapsulated styling can be applied to these replicated children, without having unintended side effects on DOM elements outside the Shadow DOM realm. 

[TODO]  Allow for transformations on the nodes after cloning.
